        <!-- <h3>Under construction - coming soon!</h3> -->

        <p><b>AgroFIMS</b> has just been migrated to a new, more flexible framework. Some functionalities are still
          being
          developed, such as the ability to set up your private account so that only you can see the fieldbooks that you
          create. This - and other nifty features will be available soon - but in the meanwhile you can test AgroFIMS
          and create fieldbooks that will remain available, but will also be visible to others. More detailed
          documentation will be available by the end of 2020, but here is some general guidance to help you use
          AgroFIMS.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Set up your experimental site (“Sites”).</li>
          <li>Add a new experiment (“Experiments”) and give it a name before creating it.</li>
          <li>Under ‘Experiment description”, specify what the experiment is about, and indicated the personnel,
            organizations, and funding agencies involved (via the “About the Experiment” and “Personnel” tabs). This is
            the metadata about the dataset.</li>
          <li>Add a fieldbook (via “Fieldbooks” tab under Experiment description), choosing the country and experimental
            site you created earlier.</li>
          <li>Add details on the site, crop, and statistical design of the experiment, choosing treatments and factors
            from the drop-down lists.</li>
          <li>Go through the “Management practices” to specify how you want the experiment to be managed.</li>
          <li>Specify crop, phenological, weather, and soil measurements that you would like to make.</li>
          <li>Once you are done, you can download the fieldbook you have created via the cloud icon at the top right.
          </li>
          <li>Your fieldbook will be created as an xlxs file that you can save to your computer.</li>
          <li>The fieldbook file can be exported from your computer to the <a href="http://www.kddart.org/kdsmart.html"
              target="_blank">KDSmart</a> application for digital data collection. <a
              href="http://www.kddart.org/kdsmart.html" target="_blank">KDSmart</a> is available for Android devices.
            Stay tuned -
            AgroFIMS will soon be available for use via the Open Data Kit (ODK) and Fieldbook applications!</li>
          <li>Once data is collected via <a href="http://www.kddart.org/kdsmart.html" target="_blank">KDSmart</a>, you
            can send it back
            to AgroFIMS for statistical analysis. This module will be available later in 2020, and includes a
            statistical report with graphs.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In 2021 <b>AgroFIMS</b> will allow you to set up agronomic survey questionnaires, for data collection via
          ODK. It
          will also allow easy upload of your “born FAIR” data to Dataverse repository platforms with Dublin
          Core-compliant metadata schemas.</p>
