        <p><b>General guidance to help you use AgroFIMS</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Set up your experimental site (in “Sites”).</li>

          <li>Add a new experiment (in “Experiments”).</li>

          <li>Then specify what the experiment is about, and indicated the personnel, organizations, and funding agencies involved (in ''Experiment''
            and “Personnel” tabs). This is the metadata about the dataset.</li>

          <li>Add a fieldbook (in “Fieldbooks” tab), choosing the country and experimental site you created earlier.</li>

          <li>Add details on the site, crop, and statistical design of the experiment, choosing treatments and factors from the drop-down lists.</li>

          <li>Go through the “Management practices” to specify how you want the experiment to be managed.</li>

          <li>Specify crop, phenological, weather, and soil measurements that you would like to make.</li>

          <li>Once you are done, you can download the fieldbook you have created via the cloud icon at the top right. The fieldbook file can be
            downloaded as an Excel file or as a KDSmart or Field Book compatible files for digital data collection. KDSmart and Field Book are
            available for Android devices. S
            Once data is collected via KDSmart, you can send it back to AgroFIMS for statistical analysis. This module will soone be available and
            includes a statistical report with graphs.</li>

        <p><b>AgrAPI</b><br>
          We have made available the Agronomy API or AgrAPI, which is a RESTful web service API specification to enable access, exchange, and
          integration of agronomic data across systems and applications. You can use the API to retrieve research management information, experimental
          designs, crop measurements, and environmental variables from AgroFIMS. The AgrAPI blueprint can be implemented in different programming
          languages. Currently, AgrAPI is implemented in the R statistical programming language allowing you to analyze your data with the R
          statistical packages and graphics of your choice.
