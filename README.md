# AgroFIMS Angular code

AgroFIMS New Repository - New WebFramework. This is based on Angular Material https://material.angular.io/

Angular Material is a fully responsive administration template. Highly customizable and easy to use. Fits many screen resolutions from small mobile devices to large desktops.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

## Overview

`The Agronomy Field Information Management System (AgroFIMS)` has been developed based on CGIAR’s `HIDAP` (Highly-interactive Data Analysis Platform created by CGIAR’s `International Potato Center`, CIP). AgroFIMS draws fully on ontologies, particularly the Agronomy Ontology and the `Crop Ontology`. It consists of modules that represent the typical cycle of operations in agronomic trial management, and enables the creation of data collection sheets using the same ontology-based set of variables, terminology, units and protocols. AgroFIMS therefore:

Standardizes data collection and description for easy aggregation and inter-linking across disparate datasets; Allows easy integration with HIDAP breeding data, or any other ontology-based datasets; Functions as a data staging repository, allowing data uploads with view/edit permissions; Enables data quality checks, statistical analysis of the data collected, and the generation of sophisticated statistics reports; Aligns a priori with CGIAR’s CG Core metadata schema; Enables easy upload to the institutional repositories, and much more. Funding for AgroFIMS was provided by the `Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s`, `Open Access`, `Open Data Initiative`, and the `CGIAR Big Data Platform`.
